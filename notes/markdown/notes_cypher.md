# Cypher Query Language

* declarative graph query language
* pattern oriented
* allows to focus on your application domains instead of getting lost in technicalities
  * focuses on the clarity of expression *what* to retrieve from a graph and now *how* to retrieve it
  * very expressive
* relatively small but yet still very powerful
* easily read and understood by *developers,* *db professionnals* and *business stakeholders*

### Basic Query Structure

#### Graph traversal / Data retrieval

##### MATCH clause

- how it really works is that you specify pattern that represent an example on how to traverse the graph



- indicates the pattern which should be used to traverse the graph
- placeholders may be present to capture and use different information within the query
  - use those variables throughout the query	






- to find data for specific nodes and relationships in an existing dataset, we specify the property values explicitely:

``` 
MATCH (emil: Person {name:'Emil'})-[:KNOWS]->(ian:Person {name:'Ian'})
```

##### WHERE clause

may be bundled with a `WHERE` clause

``` 
MATCH (n1:NodeLabel1)-->(n2:NodeLabel2)
```

- adds constraint to a match pattern or to filter results that passes through the `MATCH` clause

##### RETURN clause

used to state what a query should return

#### Examples

``` 
MATCH (cust:Customer)-[:PURCHASED]->(:Order)-[o:ORDERS]->(p:Product),
      (p)-[:PART_OF]->(c:Category {categoryName:"Produce"})
RETURN DISTINCT cust.contactName as CustomerName, SUM(o.quantity) AS TotalProductsPurchased
```

* *cust*, *o*, *p*, *c* are *placeholders* that captures the informations
* use of pattern matching to specify a graph traversal
* (node_placeholder:NodeLabel)-[:RELATIONSHIP_NAME]->(node_placeholder2:NodeLabel {propertyName: "property"})

``` 
MATCH (js:Person)-[:KNOWS]-()-[:KNOWS]-(surfer)
WHERE js.name = "Johan" AND surfer.hobby = "surfing"
RETURN DISTINCT surfer
```

* use of WHERE clause to enforce constraint or filter information

#### Graph manipulation

##### CREATE

* creates all the new part of a pattern : (*create a new :Bar node and a :FOO relationship that is associated with a node having id = 1*)

``` 
MATCH (n) WHERE id = 1 CREATE (n)-[:FOO]->(b:Bar)
```

##### MERGE

Will `MATCH`or `CREATE` (only if it doesn't exists)

#### Aggregation functions

cypher has various built-in functions like `count()` `sum()` `avg()` `min()` 

#### Indexes / Constraints

* uniquely idenfifying object defined in Neo4j
* mainly used by `MERGE` queries to ensure nodes are uniquely created
* much more like SQL

``` 
CREATE CONSTRAINT on (u:User) ASSERT u.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE INDEX on :User(name);
```

and then users are uniquely identified through *name*

#### Examples

``` 
MATCH (neo:Database {name:"Neo4j"})
MATCH (johan:Person {name:"Johan"})
CREATE (johan)-[:FRIEND]->(:Person:Expert {name:"Max"})-[:WORKED_WITH]->(neo)
```

``` 
MATCH (you {name:"You"}), (expert)-[:WORKED_WITH]->(db:Database {name:"Neo4j"}),
  p = shortestPath( (you)-[:FRIEND*..5]-(expert) )
RETURN p,db
```

#### SQL vs Cypher

```
SELECT DISTINCT co_actor.name
FROM person AS keanu
  JOIN acted_in AS acted_in1 ON acted_in1.person_id = keanu.id
  JOIN acted_in AS acted_in2 ON acted_in2.movie_id = acted_in1.movie_id
  JOIN person AS co_actor
    ON acted_in2.person_id = co_actor.id AND co_actor.id <> keanu.id
WHERE keanu.name = 'Keanu Reeves';
```

vs 

```
MATCH (keanu:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie),
(coActor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie)
WHERE keanu.name = 'Keanu Reeves'
RETURN DISTINCT coActor.name;
```

* notice how more expressive the cypher query is
* much more related on the application domain and not necessarily the technicalities involved in the SQL query

#### Common pitfalls

* Although very expressive, not sure a particular graph if fit for purpose

* Easy to make mistakes if misused

  ```
  MATCH (:Person)-[:KNOWS]-()-[:KNOWS]->(:Person)
  ```

  - the `()` specifies any specific nodes that associated with 2 `KNOWS`relation; but they can be anything if no label specified, not necessarily `:Person`
  - binds so naturally that sometimes queries might hide logic errors 
    - (one might assume that only a :Person can be associted with 2 :KNOWS relationship), however one could add a totally different node with 2 :KNOWS relationship and it would still be matched by this query.

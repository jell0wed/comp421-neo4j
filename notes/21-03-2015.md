# Graph Database

## Advantages

those were taken from their website [http://neo4j.com/why-graph-databases/]

* **performance** : performance tends to stay constent as your data grows
* **flexibility**: the structure and schema may flexes as applications & industry changes; easy to maintain and change schema
* **agility**: aligns with today's agile and test-driven development techniques; easy to evolve with

## Data Modeling

taken form [http://neo4j.com/blog/data-modeling-basics/] and [http://neo4j.com/developer/graph-db-vs-rdbms/]

### Comparing to the traditional relational model

foreign key, join tables = layers of complexity (required in a traditional relational model) 

**in graph based relational model**: we enrich by adding labels and attributes & relationships

relational databases have *rigid* schemas and complex data modeling process- they are not suited for rapid change

### Graph-based databases

Composed of two elements : 

- **node** : represents and entity (person, place, thing, category) - are the data records in the graph
- **relationship** : how two nodes/entities are associated

#### Neo4J as a graph database

- **properties**: named data values - stores the data associated witg nodes
- **labels**: attributed to nodes to group multiple nodes together
  - *example*: in a social graph, apply label "persons" to multiple nodes
  - nodes may have multiple label associated 
- **relationship**: are connecting two nodes
  - **properties**: relationship can also have data attached with *propeties*. 
  - *example:* Ian Knows Email since 5 yrs

#### Schema

Neo4j is a schema-optional graph database, you can you a schema or not.

#### Cypher - Neo4j query language

``` cypher
CREATE (ee:Person { name: "Emil", from: "Sweden", klout: 99 })
```

`CREATE` clause creastes a new node

`ee:Person` creates a new node ee labelled as a *Person*.

`{}` properties associated with the node

``` 
MATCH (ee:Person) WHERE ee.name = "Emil" RETURN ee;
```

`MATCH` clause matches a specified node or relationship

`(ee:Person)` specifies the pattern we are looking for (ie. single node with label 'Person') and will assign variable *ee* to it.

``` 
MATCH (ee:Person) WHERE ee.name = "Emil"
CREATE (js:Person { name: "Johan", from: "Sweden", learn: "Surfin'" }),
	   (jp:Person { name: "Jérémie", from: "Canada", learn: "Somethin'" })
       (ee)-[:KNOWS { since: 2001 }]->(jp),
       (jp)-[:KNOWS { since: 1994 }]->(js)
```

Matches *ee* with a person named Emil

Creates a person *js* names Johan and *jp* named *Jérémie* and 

- associates nodes *ee* with *jp* with a KNOWS relationship and a property since 
- associates nodes *jp* with *js* with a KNOWS relationship and a property since

``` 
MATCH (ee:Person)-[:KNOWS]-(friends)
WHERE ee.name = "Emil" RETURN ee, friends
```

matches people associated with *Emil* that have a KNOWS relationship associating them with him.

``` 
MATCH (js:Person)-[:KNOWS]-()-[:KNOWS]-(surfer)
WHERE js.name = "Johan" AND surfer.hobby = "surfing"
RETURN DISTINCT surfer
```

``` 
MATCH (cust:Customer)-[:PURCHASED]->(:Order)-[o:ORDERS]->(p:Product),
      (p)-[:PART_OF]->(c:Category {categoryName:"Produce"})
RETURN DISTINCT cust.contactName as CustomerName, SUM(o.quantity) AS TotalProductsPurchased
```

- very easy and natural to query on relationships within entities
- very natural query language

# Graph Database

## Advantages

those were taken from their website [http://neo4j.com/why-graph-databases/]

* **performance** : performance tends to stay constent as your data grows
* **flexibility**: the structure and schema may flexes as applications & industry changes; easy to maintain and change schema
* **agility**: aligns with today's agile and test-driven development techniques; easy to evolve with

## Data Modeling

taken form [http://neo4j.com/blog/data-modeling-basics/] and [http://neo4j.com/developer/graph-db-vs-rdbms/]

### Comparing to the traditional relational model

foreign key, join tables = layers of complexity (required in a traditional relational model) 

**in graph based relational model**: we enrich by adding labels and attributes & relationships

relational databases have *rigid* schemas and complex data modeling process- they are not suited for rapid change

### Graph-based databases

Composed of two elements : 

- **node** : represents and entity (person, place, thing, category)
- **relationship** : how two nodes/entities are associated
- **properties**: named data values
